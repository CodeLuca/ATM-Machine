# ATM Machine

This is an ATM Machine project made for my apprenticeship using the following technologies:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for the frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) for the backend
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styles (using the SCSS syntax)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compilation
